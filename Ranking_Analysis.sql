-- INSIGHTS:
-- 
-- 1. The top 5 highest revenue-generating products are all variants of the Mountain-200 bike, showing strong demand for this specific model line.
-- 2. Low-revenue products are primarily inexpensive accessories like socks, patches, and cleaning kitsâ€”indicating limited standalone profitability.
-- 3. At a subcategory level, 'Road Bikes', 'Mountain Bikes', and 'Touring Bikes' dominate revenue generation, reinforcing the idea that core bicycle products are the main revenue drivers.
-- 4. Categories like 'Socks', 'Cleaners', and 'Caps' contribute the least revenue, and may be better positioned as add-ons, bundled products, or promotional giveaways.
-- 5. A strategic opportunity exists in upselling high-margin items and bundling low-performing accessories with premium bike models to increase their overall contribution.
