# My SQL EDA Project
By Mohak Pachpor | MBA First-Year | IIT Kanpur  This project involves performing SQL-based Exploratory Data Analysis on a simulated retail data warehouse containing customer, product, and sales tables. The objective was to derive business insights while strengthening hands-on SQL and data handling skills.
Here is a professional and polished README file for your EDA Project: Business & Sales Analysis, written in the tone of an MBA student, ready to be added to your GitHub repository.

Project Overview

This project focuses on conducting an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover meaningful business insights from a structured sales dataset. Using SQL as the primary querying tool, the analysis spans customer segmentation, product performance, sales contribution by category, and ranking-based revenue evaluations.

Dataset Overview

The analysis is based on three relational tables:
	•	dim_customers: Contains demographic information like customer ID, gender, and country.
	•	dim_products: Includes product-level data such as category, subcategory, product name, and cost.
	•	fact_sales: Contains transactional data including product key, customer key, and sales amount.
