# SQL_EDA_Project
By Mohak Pachpor | MBA First-Year | IIT Kanpur  This project involves performing SQL-based Exploratory Data Analysis on a simulated retail data warehouse containing customer, product, and sales tables. The objective was to derive business insights while strengthening hands-on SQL and data handling skills.
Here is a professional and polished README file for your EDA Project: Business & Sales Analysis, written in the tone of an MBA student, ready to be added to your GitHub repository.

Project Overview

This project focuses on conducting an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover meaningful business insights from a structured sales dataset. Using SQL as the primary querying tool, the analysis spans customer segmentation, product performance, sales contribution by category, and ranking-based revenue evaluations.

The project is structured into two main parts:
	1.	Magnitude Analysis: To understand the scale and volume across different business dimensions.
	2.	Ranking Analysis: To identify top and bottom performers across key performance indicators such as revenue and product contribution.

This project reflects analytical thinking and a data-driven decision-making approach, aligning with the practical problem-solving mindset developed in an MBA curriculum.

Dataset Overview

The analysis is based on three relational tables:
	•	dim_customers: Contains demographic information like customer ID, gender, and country.
	•	dim_products: Includes product-level data such as category, subcategory, product name, and cost.
	•	fact_sales: Contains transactional data including product key, customer key, and sales amount.

Key Business Questions Answered

Magnitude Analysis

Question No.	Business Question
Q1	Total customers by countries
Q2	Total customers by gender
Q3	Total products by category
Q4	Average product cost per category
Q5	Total revenue generated per category
Q6	Revenue generated by individual customers
Q7	Revenue distribution across countries

Key Insights from Magnitude Analysis
	•	Geographic Spread: The United States and Australia lead in customer count and sales volume, indicating strong regional market penetration.
	•	Gender Mix: Customer base is fairly balanced across genders, reflecting a diverse and inclusive consumer group.
	•	Product Assortment: ‘Components’ lead in count, while ‘Bikes’ dominate in both average cost and revenue share.
	•	Revenue Distribution: Sales are highly concentrated in the ‘Bikes’ category, indicating this is the core product line driving profitability.
	•	Top Markets: United States and Australia are major revenue hubs, whereas smaller markets like Germany and France still show significant traction.
	•	Customer Contribution: Top 10 customers generate substantial sales, showcasing the classic Pareto Principle where a small set of customers drive a large portion of revenue.

Ranking Analysis

Question No.	Ranking-Based Insights
Q1	Top 5 revenue-generating products
Q2	Bottom 5 revenue-generating products
Q3	Top 5 revenue-generating subcategories
Q4	Bottom 5 revenue-generating subcategories

Key Insights from Ranking Analysis
	•	Top Performers: All top 5 products are variants of the Mountain-200 series, indicating strong product-market fit.
	•	Low Performers: Accessories such as socks and cleaning kits show the least revenue, potentially suitable for bundling strategies.
	•	Core Revenue Drivers: ‘Road Bikes’ and ‘Mountain Bikes’ subcategories dominate sales, justifying focused inventory and promotional efforts in these segments.
	•	Optimization Opportunity: Underperforming subcategories like ‘Socks’ and ‘Cleaners’ can be repositioned as value-adds or bundled products to enhance their contribution.

⸻

Tools & Skills Utilized
	•	SQL: Core query language used for data extraction, transformation, aggregation, and ranking.
	•	Business Interpretation: Each query was followed by business-relevant insights to support decision-making.
	•	Data Storytelling: Structured findings into thematic sections to improve stakeholder readability and actionability.
